# Candidate Approaches

1. **Linear Regression** – simple baseline using days, miles, receipts.
2. **Quadratic Polynomial** – include squared and interaction terms.
3. **6th‑Degree Polynomial with Ridge** – current approach, balances complexity and overfitting.
4. **8th‑Degree Polynomial** – more expressive but risks overfit.
5. **Decision Tree** – rule‑based splits capturing nonlinear effects.
6. **Random Forest** – ensemble of trees to reduce variance.
7. **Gradient Boosting** – sequential trees focusing on residuals.
8. **k‑Nearest Neighbors** – memory‑based interpolation of known cases.
9. **Neural Network** – small feedforward net for complex patterns.
10. **Rules + ML Hybrid** – heuristics from interviews with ML residual correction.
11. **Piecewise Linear Models** – different formulas for trip categories.
12. **Probabilistic Model** – treat reimbursements as distribution conditioned on inputs.
